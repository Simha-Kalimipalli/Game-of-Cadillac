# Game_of_Cadilac
This is a project that I try to write in every new language I learn. Cadillac (or "31") is a lesser known card game related to Blackjack. Here is the [rule set](https://www.coololdgames.com/card-games/gambling/thirty-one/) I used for the game. This card game also has an optional AI opponent that uses Min/max concepts. The GUI is made with ASCII characters (with the Colorama library). I am currently trying to replicate this game using LLM Prompting. 

The Python version is complete. I'm currently working on the c++ version.

Heres a sample image of the gameplay:
